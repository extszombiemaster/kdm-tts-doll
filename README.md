# Roadmap (copied from Mei's depending on how much I care I may get to this, no promises though)
* Documentation / video tutorial.
* Speed up load times. 1.0 slowed things down due to using XML UI for everything.
* White box content and setup in campaign UI.
* Strains. Need UI to incorporate which strain FAs at the start of a new campaign. Need to think how to best do this.
* Get rid of unused terrain reset button.
* Battle UI button tooltips
* Save state should remember whether Battle UI was open.
* Hunt event buttons: random hunt event (show roll), forest gate, overwhelming darkness, sky fishing, herb gathering, mineral gathering.
* Monster-specific quotes.
* Lock terrain after setting up showdown.
* Fixed Binge eating hagve misspelling.
* Add reroll token and a slot on the token board.
* Constellation and import/export boards have slightly different colors than the rest of the boards.
* Rescan all gear.
* Rescan terrain tiles.
* Rescan tokens.
* Rescan rules, especially expansions.
* Scan Spidicules.
* Scan Resin Dung Ball.
* Scan Spiderling.
* Scan Lonely Fruit.
* Scan more survivors: goal is to do at least one new armor set per version.
* Add tooltips before loading.
* Move search, battle UI, and next turn into a single unified and consistent main menu, hideable by the existing button.
* Evasion on Battle UI.
* Dice roll buttons on Battle UI?
* Custom severe injury board with buttons to spawn cards/tokens for each table entry.
* Support for PotStars constellations on survivor sheets
* "Spawn Anything": similar to the existing search for rules, but search for any item.
* Timeline custom hunt event.
* Add more decorations: Rules Nav, Survivor Board
* Add all glossary terms to rules search.
* Add all rules subsections to rules search.
* Remember player figurine when packed.
* Dedicated board for new survivor bonuses instead of the free-form text, so it's automatically applied.
* Icon for retired.
* "Has Reroll" filter.
* "Lay out gear" button for settlement locations, similar to how the Gloomhaven mod does it.
* Custom "life" counter.
* Ability to add expansions to existing campaign.
* Redo hunt/showdown UI to only show available quarries.
* Add "Priority Target" tile into the showdown board.
* Watcher retinue tokens.
* Scan stone face bases.
* Move "Unused HL" to side column, put image in between
* Deprecated: filter -> tryObjectEnterContainer
* Manually creating survivor boxes and such by coping/etc should produce a warning message for new players.
* Reminder to pack survivors and complete encounter before exporting
* Bigger font for export/import campaign board.
* Code: Always validate Archive.Take and Container.Take...get rid of "allowMissing" and add actual validation.
* Board background color. Had a few requests to make it easier to see against the black background.
* Slots for survival token stacks on token board.
* White Lion prologue "known" cards face up
* 5/6th player. Will be very difficult and time consuming to make this work cleanly.
* Add ability card for Gigaslayer (from Gigalion).
* Export/import should record permanent tokens.
* Packing/unpacking a survivor should include cursed gear.
